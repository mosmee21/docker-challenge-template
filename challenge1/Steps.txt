Challenge 1

1. I set up Docker on my computer so I could run containers.

2. Made an account on Docker Hub for storing and managing my Docker images.

3. Went on GitHub and forked the provided repository to get my own copy to work on.

4. Opened the challenge1 folder. This is where Iâ€™ll be working.

5. Inside challenge1, I made a new folder called public to keep my web page files.

6.In the public folder, I created an index.html file and wrote the code for html file and put my name and student ID in it.

7.I then created a Dockerfile in the challenge1 directory. 
8. Ran the command docker build -t mausami/simple-web . to create a Docker image called mausami/simple-web.

9 To get my web server running, I used docker run -d -p 8080:80 mausami/simple-web.

10. I used the docker ps command to see my running containers and confirm everything was set up correctly.

11. Opened Docker Desktop, clicked the local link 8080:80, and checked my static site at localhost:8080.

12. Captured a screenshot showing my static website with my name and student ID displayed.

13. Finally, I pushed all my new changes, including the index.html and Dockerfile, to my GitHub repository under the challenge1 directory.
