The neccessary steps i ollow to complete the challenge 4:

Docker crashed due to an update, leading to a reinstall and loss of all data. After updating and reinstalling , I started from scratch to begin with challenge 4.


1.Started by copy and pasting the project files to Challenge 4 folder from the previous challenge 3.

2.After copying the files, I made sure to stop any services from Challenge 3 that were using the same ports as the ones needed for Challenge 4. This helped avoid any issues or errors during the setup process.

3.Next ,Navigated to the project directory Challenge 4 where the docker-compose.yml file was located  in the terminal.

4.Made a GET request to the application using my browser at http://localhost:8080/api/stats and recorded the hostname returned.

5.Repeated the GET request multiple times and noted down the hostname each time and researched how to scale up a Docker service and found the necessary commands.

6.Now, when I tried to scale up the "node-service" from 1 to 3 instances using the docker-compose up -d --scale node-service=3 command, I faced some challenges. I attempted this command multiple times (around 3-4 times), but it didn't work as expected. Consequently, I had to roll back by executing docker-compose down, which brought everything down.

7.Afterwards, I rebuilt the Docker containers with docker-compose up -d and decided to make some changes to the nginx configuration to handle the load balancing. I modified the nginx.config file to define an upstream block with three server blocks, each pointing to a different node service instance.

8.Additionally, I updated the docker-compose.yml file to give each node service a unique name and dependency.

9.Then, I rebuilt the containers with docker-compose up -d --build nginx, checked the status with docker-compose ps, and examined the logs with docker-compose logs nginx. Finally, I browsed to http://localhost:8080/api/stats to see if the hostname changed with each request, confirming the successful scaling of the service.

10.In the end, I took screenshots of everything important to show that I finished the challenge. I snapped shots of the terminal where I ran Docker commands, the browser showing different hostnames, and any logs or messages confirming that the service was scaled up.

11.In summary, the whole process starting from reinstalltion to get the 3 different hostnames it took approximately 3-4 hours to achieve the outcome.
